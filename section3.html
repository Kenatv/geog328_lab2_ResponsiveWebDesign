        Corgis are active and energetic dogs that require a well-balanced diet to sustain 
        their energy levels and overall health. The ideal diet for a Corgi should include 
        high-quality proteins, essential fats, easily digestible carbohydrates, and a balanced 
        mix of vitamins and minerals. Proper nutrition is crucial for supporting their physical 
        activity and preventing health issues.
