        Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, 
        the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a strong, athletic, and 
        lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy. 
        They are one the world's most popular herding breeds. At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder 
        and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. 
        Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day's work. 
        Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, 
        and black and tan, with or without white markings. The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who 
        enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, 
        they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a 'big dog' 
        bark. Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke's need for activity and togetherness will 
        never have a more loyal, loving pet.

        <h3 class="information">Health Information</h3>

        The Pembroke is typically a healthy breed, and responsible breeders screen their 
        stock for health conditions such as elbow and hip dysplasia, eye disorders, cardiac 
        issues, degenerative myelopathy, and von Willebrand's disease, a bleeding disorder. 
        As with all breeds, a Pembroke's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, 
        and the teeth should be brushed regularly.
