        The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a masterpiece of the breeder's art: 
        Every aspect of its makeup is perfectly suited to moving cattle, and yet it is so 
        congenial and sweet-faced that it would be a cherished companion even if it never 
        did a day's work. Long, low-set dogs with sturdy bone, short legs, and a deep chest, 
        Cardigans are powerful workers of deceptive speed and grace. Cardis can weigh anywhere 
        from 25 to 34 pounds, with females at the lower end of the scale. They come in several 
        coat colors, from red to the popular blue-merle pattern. The quickest way to distinguish 
        Cardis from their cousins, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, is to check out the hindquarters: Cardigans 
        have tails; Pembrokes do not. Cardis are trainable, faithful, and vigilant guardians with a 
        'big dog' bark. Well-socialized Cardis are especially fond of kids and agreeable with other 
        pets. These athletic, rugged herders have a love for the outdoors, and they thrive on mental 
        stimulation and physical activity.

        <h3 class="information">Health Information</h3>
        The Cardigan is in general a very healthy breed, and responsible breeders  
        will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, progressive 
        retinal atrophy (PRA), and degenerative myelopathy. And as with any 'long and low' 
        canine, one must be cognizant of potential back issues. Avoid letting the Cardigan 
        jump down off the bed or couch, and stairs can also be a hazard. At the first sign 
        of any distress or discomfort, see the vet right away. The sooner a problem is caught, 
        the quicker the recovery.
